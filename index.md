I am DJ Dominic Locura from Berlin Mitte. I have been making music for many years. Started in my school days as a bedroom DJ only with DJ software, over several years with turntables and vinyl in clubs and discos, I am now back to digital DJ and play irregularly at some public or private events.

## Upcoming public gigs

* 23.06.22 - Christopher Street Day Berlin (Wagen der Freien Demokratischen Partei)
